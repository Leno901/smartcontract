# MyToken Solidity Contract

## Description

This Solidity smart contract is an example that demonstrates error-handling mechanisms in Ethereum smart contracts. It features `require()`, `assert()`, and `revert()` functions to handle different scenarios and errors in a smart contract.

- The `require()` function enforces specific conditions for executing functions.
- The `assert()` function checks conditions that should always be true.
- The `revert()` function is used to handle explicit error scenarios.

## Usage

This contract can serve as a reference for error-handling in your own smart contracts. You can deploy and interact with it on a development Ethereum network or a local blockchain environment.

### Functions

1. **setValue(uint256 _newValue)**: Sets a new value for the contract's `value` variable, provided that the caller is the contract owner and the new value is greater than the current value.

2. **assertv(uint256 x, uint256 y)**: A pure function that demonstrates the usage of the `assert()` function. It checks if a condition is always true.

3. **revertv(uint256 x, uint256 y)**: A pure function that demonstrates the usage of the `revert()` function. It reverts the transaction if the sum of `x` and `y` would result in an overflow.
